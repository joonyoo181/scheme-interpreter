# Scheme Interpreter
A Scheme interpreter coded from scratch using Python

## Summary
Scheme is a dialect of the Lisp family of programming languages. This program provides the backend system modules for a terminal to run Scheme programs.
Utilizes lexical analysis and syntactial analysis to read, parse, evaluate, and print Scheme code. Employed tail recursion for efficient computing (constant space complexity)

### Running the program
1) Download the files
2) Inside the terminal, run ```python scheme.py``` or ```python3 scheme.py``` depending on the version

### Exiting the program
1) Press ```Ctrl-d``` or evaluate ```(exit)``` in the interpreter

### Evaluating the expressions in an input file
1) Run the command ```python3 scheme.py <file_name>.scm``` or ```python3 scheme.py <file_name>.scm``` depending on the version
