# Scheme Interpreter
A Python-based Scheme interpreter, utilizing lexical and syntactic analysis to parse, evaluate, and output.

## Summary
Scheme is a dialect of the Lisp family of programming languages. This program provides the backend system modules for a terminal to interpret a subset of Scheme programs.

Features of the interpreter:
- lexical analysis and syntactical analysis to read, parse, evaluate, and print Scheme code
- tail recursion for handling recursive calls in O(1) space complexity

### Using the Interpreter
1) Clone the repository
2) In the terminal, ```cd``` inside the cloned directory, 
3) Run ```python scheme.py``` or ```python3 scheme.py``` depending on your Python version
4) To exit, press ```Ctrl-d``` or evaluate ```(exit)``` in the interpreter
5) To interpret Scheme files (```.scm```), run ```python3 scheme.py <file_name>.scm``` or ```python3 scheme.py <file_name>.scm``` depending on your Python version
